# GTAV-Autonomus-Driver
First Try to Build an Autonomous Driver
In this project, I aimed to train an algorithm that drives a car on GTA V. For that, many screen shots were taken via OpenCV win32api and PIL. Win32api was used in order to detect the frame of GTA V. PIL was served to grab screen shots. Screen shots were taken from more than one-hour lasting gameplay, in which I drove car on GTA V. While I was driving car, a script has taken screen shots and the keys which I pressed. Keys were W – A - D. After that all screen shots and pressed keys were taken, images were turned into black and white images and dimensions were smaller scaled with using OpenCV. So that sizes of images were reduced and training time was noticeably reduced. In order to train images, a Tensorflow – Keras – based neural network algorithm was used and implemented. Training sets were saved as .pb file and image sets were saved as .npy file

As a result, algorithm was so successful to go straight. Sometimes the car goes only right so that it stays stuck and draws circle. Although distribution was fairly weighted, left direction, left was less used in compared to right direction.
